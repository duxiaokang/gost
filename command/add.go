	<pathName>
		It's a given name to be used to represent <path>. It's unique within the pathspace.
		When one is trying to add a new path with a name existed in the pathspace, the original
		path info would be overwritten.
	<path>
		It's the path to be add to the pathspace and it would be set as GOPATH once selected
		when running a go command. It can be a single absolute path or multiple separated by
		the os's legal PATH separator(':' in Darwin for example). When it's multiple, a '-m'
		or '--multi' flag should be marked.
	[-m | --multi]
		It's used to mark that the <path> is multiple like '/home/foo/bar:/home/foo/baz'

example: gost add foobar '/home/foo/bar:/home/foo/baz' -m`,
