// docCmd represents the doc command
var docCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "doc [-p | --path {pathName}] -- [goFlags] [goArgs]",
	Short: "Set specified path as GOPATH and run 'go doc'",
	Long: `Set specified path as GOPATH and run 'go doc'. If no path has been
specified, gost would try to check if current working directory was under
any single path in its pathspace. And if gost found one, it would set it
as the GOPATH and then run 'go doc'. If you want to use a multiple path
like '/home/foo/bar:home/foo/baz', it's a must to use -p or --path to
specify the pathName defined in pathspace.

	[-p | --path {pathName}]
		It's used to specify the path to set as GOPATH before running the
		corresponding go command.
	[goFlags] [goArgs]
		These content following '--' would be passed directly to the underlying
		go command.

example: gost doc -p foobar -- github.com/baz/qux`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		processor.RunGoCmd(cmd.Name(), args)
	},
}

func init() {
	RootCmd.AddCommand(docCmd)
	docCmd.SetHelpFunc(processor.RunGoHelp)
}
